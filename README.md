## Evaluation of Neural Network Performance with CPU, GPU, TPU

## Description

The field of AI is evolving rapidly and there are many applications which tend to make machines more intelligent. Computer Vision is one of the problem domains under Machine Learning which is the sub field of AI. CV is related to making a machine see and perceive through graphical data. Making machines learn is a time-consuming task. This is because they need to get trained on thousands of data samples. Processing these samples takes a lot of time and hence underlying hardware architecture plays a vital role in decreasing the time taken to train the model. This report is based on comparison of different hardware architectures for training Neural Network for the classification task. It compares Central Processing Unit, Graphic Processing unit and Tensor Processing Unit architectures. Google cloud based TPU, CUDA enabled GPU and CPU are used for comparison. 


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* We did our code part entirely on Cloud platform that is Google Colab

for reference im attaching this note book files in source folder

### Installing

* pip install tensorflow == 1.13.1

### Executing program


* go through the above colab links 
* Run TPU notebook in colab with Runtime as TPU
* Run GPU notebook in colab with Runtime as GPU
* Run CPU notebook in colab with Runtime as CPU
* Run comparision notebook in colab with any runtime envoirnment.
